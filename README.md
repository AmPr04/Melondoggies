# Music Fan Blog (Static)

https://ampr04.github.io/Melondoggies/

This is a small static music fan blog template. It includes:

- `index.html` — main page with posts and a playlist
- `css/styles.css` — responsive styles
- `js/script.js` — renders posts, playlist and manages the audio player

How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Customize the `posts` and `playlist` arrays in `js/script.js`.
3. Place audio files in a `media/` folder next to `index.html`.

Notes

- This is a static site — no build step required.
- For production, host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host.
